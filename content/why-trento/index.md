_Trento is a city on the Adige River in Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol in Italy.
[...] It is one of the nation's wealthiest and most prosperous cities, [...]
often ranking highly among Italian cities for quality of life, standard of
living, and business and job opportunities._ ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trento))

Inspired by the qualities of Trento city and our goal of providing a better life quality for the SAP Administrators, we felt that _Trento_ was the right choice for the project name.

We hope that using our project makes you feel like visiting Trento and provides you a great time!
