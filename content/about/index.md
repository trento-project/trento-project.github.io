SAP Applications represent most of the biggest mission-critical systems in the world, which makes it extremely important and complex. Also, the increasing pace of new technological trends adoption requires modern solutions to support the speed imposed by the digital transformation era.

The Trento project was conceived to address this complexity and abstract the challenges of operating SAP workloads away from sensitive Operative System tasks.

### Our Vision

Our vision is to provide a great and simplified experience for SAP Applications system administrators, especially for the ones transitioning to Linux and public clouds.

### Our Mission

Our mission is to deliver, via a cloud-native web console, an easy-to-use solution focused on simplifying and automating the SAP Applications Operating system routines a sysadm needs to perform when using a Linux operating system.

Our goal is to accomplish that using modern technologies fostering a "maintenance-free" infrastructure based on modern concepts like automated service discovery and automated operations, observability, configuration-as-code, among others. 

### Why Trento?

_Trento is a city on the Adige River in Trentino-Alto Adige/SÃ¼dtirol in Italy.
[...] It is one of the nation's wealthiest and most prosperous cities, [...]
often ranking highly among Italian cities for quality of life, standard of
living, and business and job opportunities._ ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trento))

Inspired by the qualities of Trento city and our goal of providing Quality of Life improvements in the daily tasks of SAP Administrators, we felt that _Trento_ was the right choice for the project name.

We hope that using our project makes you feel like visiting Trento and provides you a great time!
