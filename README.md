# Trento Static Web Site
This project holds both the sources and the compiled artifact (hosted on GitHub Pages) of the www.trento-project.io website.  
It is made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

## Contributing

First, [get Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/).

The Hero and other common features of the theme are set in ´config.yaml´.

If you need to add content, just put a new markdown file inside the ´content´ directory, according to existing directory structure (please refer to Hugo docs for more info, or try to figure it out from existing content). 

If you need to customize the css, edit the ´themes/hugo-refresh/assets/style.sass´.
